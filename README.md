App to ...

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Compose](http://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Nodejs and npm](https://nodejs.org) - suggested to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

Install script _should work_ for debian linux distributions

`./scripts/local/install_software.sh`

## Initialize project and reset blockchain

Do this before running the first time or if you need to reset the blockchain. Note this will reset the blockchain state back to having a few accounts with all app history deleted.

`./start.sh reset`

## Run

`./start.sh`

or manually (important to run with the `-d` command)

`docker-compose up -d`


## Stop

Note that BOTH commands are needed to safely stop the application, otherwise the blockchain node does not exit properly.

`docker exec -it eosio pkill nodeos & docker-compose down`

If the the blockchain nodeo does not exit properly then you may need to reset the blockchain (see "Initialize npm projects and blockchain").
